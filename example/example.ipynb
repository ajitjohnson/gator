    "#### To do so, the first step is to create examples of `postive` and `negative` cells for each marker of interest. To facilitate this process, we can use the `generateThumbnails` function in `GATOR`. Under the hood the function identifies the cells that has high and low expression of the marker of interest and cuts out small thumbnails from the image. The high and low thresholds can be adjusted using the `threshold` parameter. The default (`threshold=[2, 12, 88, 98]`) threshold is defined by low: 2-12 percentile; high: 88-98 percentile. This should work fine for most cases. "

Briefly, the function takes in the single-cell table (`csvPath`) with X and Y coordinates, the full image (`imagePath`) and lastly a list of `markers` for which thumbnails need to be generated. Please note as the program does not know which channels in the image corresponds to the `markers`, hence, the channel number of the `markers` also need to be provided via `markerChannels`. The `markerChannels` follow 1-indexing convention- so the first channel is represented by the number `1`. \n",

This basically means that even if more than 50 cells passed the set high and low percentile threshold, only 50 random cells will be used to generate the thumbnails. I generally generate a minimum of `2000` cells. As this is for illustration purpose only, I have set it to `50`. \n",

If there are any truly negative thumbnails in the `TruePos` folder, move it to `PosToNeg` folder. Similarly, if there are any truly positive thumbnails in `TrueNeg` folder, move it to `NegToPos` folder. You will often notice that imaging artifacts are captured in the `TruePos` folder and there will also likely be a number of true positives in the `TrueNeg` folder as the field of view (64x64) is larger than what the program used to identify those thumbnails (just the centroids of single cells at the center of that thumbnail).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### While you are manually sorting the postives and negative thumbnails, please keep in mind that you are looking for high-confident positives and high-confident negatives. It is absolutely okay to delete off majority of the thumbnails that you are not confident about. This infact makes it easy and fast as you are looking to only keep only thumbnails that are readily sortable.\n",

If you look at the thumbnails of this dummy example, you will notice that most thumbnails of `TrueNeg` for `ECAD_1` does contain some level of `ECAD` as there is not enough regions to sample from. "

    "#### You might have noticed in the above example, I had set `localNorm=True`, by default it is set to `False`. This parameter essentially creates a mirror duplicate copy of all the thumbnails and saves it under a folder named `localNorm`. The difference being that each thumbnail is normalized to the maximum intensity pixel in that thumbnail. It helps me to visually sort out the true positives and negatives faster and more reliably. As we will not use the thumbnails in the `localNorm` for training the deep learning model, we want to make sure all the manual sorting that we did in the `localNorm` folder is copied over to the real training data. I have written an additional function to help with this. Any moving or deleting of files that you did in the `localNorm` folder will be copied over to the real training data.\n",
